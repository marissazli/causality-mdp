A 5-10% tip is considered sufficient.\n* Try to learn some basic German phrases such as \"Danke\" (thank you), \"Bitte\" (please), and \"Auf Wiedersehen\" (goodbye).\n* Be mindful of punctuality and respect local schedules.\n\nSome specific customs in Saarbr\u00fccken include:\n\n* The city has a strong mining heritage, and it's considered respectful to visit the Saar Coal Mine museum with an open mind.\n* The locals are proud of their cultural diversity, so be sure to try some of the traditional Saxon dishes and drinks during your stay.\n\nTo get more insights on local customs and etiquette, I'd like to consult with our PLANNING AGENT.
