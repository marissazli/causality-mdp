Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation? A: Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization, B: Complication of the IVC filter placement, C: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, D: Hematoma of the left thigh"
